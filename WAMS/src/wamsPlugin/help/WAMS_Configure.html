    <h1>Welfare Acoustic Monitoring System</h1>
    <h2>Creation and Configuration</h2>
    <br>
    <h3>Creating a WAMS module</h3>
    <p>
        From the <strong><em>File &gt; Add Modules &gt; Utilities</em></strong>
        menu, select "NMMF WAMS". Enter a descriptive name for the new module and
        press OK.
    </p>
    <p>
        The WAMS module requires a Detector module, such as the <a
        href="_mainHelp_detectors/whistleMoanHelp/docs/whistleMoan_Overview.html">Whistle
        & Moan Detector</a> or <a
        href="_mainHelp_detectors/clickDetectorHelp/docs/ClickDetector_clickDetector.html">Click
        Detector</a>, to be loaded in order to function properly. To simplify
        configuration, it is recommended that the detector module be added to
        PAMGuard before the WAMS module is configured.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition, a database module and binary store module must be included
        in order to store output data from the detector and WAMS modules. These
        modules do not need to be added to PAMGuard before the WAMS module is
        added or configured, but they must be added prior to processing.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><a name="WAMSConfig">Configuring a WAMS module</a></h3>
    <p>
        From the Settings menu, select "NMMF WAMS Parameters".
    </p>
    <img alt="" src="images/wamsSettingsLink.PNG">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        A new dialog should appear containing four tabs: <a
        href="#wams_SourceTab">Source Data</a>, <a
        href="#wams_Alarms">Alarms</a>, <a
        href="#wams_Output">Output</a>, and <a
        href="#wams_Reports">Reports</a></p>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><a name="wams_SourceTab">Source Data tab</a></h3>
    <img alt="" src="images/wamsParamsDialog.PNG">
    <br>
    <br>
    <h4>Source Detector</h4>
    <p>
        The WAMS module requries a source for the detections to monitor. A
        drop-down text box will list every detector module currently added to
        PAMGuard.
    </p>
    <h4>Time Interval</h4>
    <p>
        The size of each time division needs to be specified, in minutes. The
        default, 60 minutes, means that each day will be broken up into 24
        one-hour intervals. In the event that the value is not evenly divisible
        into the minutes of a day, the closest even value will be used (e.g. if
        125 minutes is entered, 120 minute intervals (6/day) will be used instead).
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that, in order to remain consistent with the time keeping
        throughout PAMGuard, all times are based on a UTC time zone (i.e.
        PAMGuard Time). Therefore the counts shown in the display tables may not
        match the local computer time period. This must be kept in mind for
        post-processing and analysis.
    </p>
    <h4>Angle Veto</h4>
    <p>
        Many detector modules, including both the Whistle & Moan Detector and
        Click Detector, calculate bearing angles when there are 2 or more
        hydrophone elements in the array. When bearing information is available
        for detections, bearings that fall within a specific range can be
        excluded from the count. This is useful for ignoring false detections
        coming from a known direction, such as ship noise or animals in
        enclosures in close proximity to the species of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
        To enable or disable the angle veto, check or uncheck the box.
    </p>
    <p>
        Angles are specified in degrees and should fall within the range
        -180&deg and 180&deg. 0&deg is defined as the direction of the primary
        axis of the array, based on the current <a
        href="_mainHelp_utilities/hydrophoneArrayManagerHelp/docs/Array_Configuration.html">
        array configuration</a>.
    </p>
    <h4>Harmonics Detector</h4>
    <p>
        In the presence of signals with harmonic components (e.g. burst pulses),
        the Whistle & Moan Detector will often treat the individual harmonics as
        separate whistle contours, in turn artificially increasing the WAMS
        count.
    </p>
    <img src="images/wamsBurstPulses.PNG">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        In order to minimize this, a simple Harmonic Detector can be configured
        within the WAMS plugin to disregard contours with similar
        starting/ending points and require a minimum amount of time between
        contours to be considered separate detections.
    </p>
    <p>
        To enable or disable the harmonics detector, check or uncheck the box.
    </p>
    <p>
        For two contours to be considered a harmonic and only counted once, <em>both</em> the
        start times and end times must fall within a certain number of
        milliseconds of each other.  This threshold value can be adjusted in the first text box.
    </p>
    <p>
        The harmonics detector compares the current detection to previous
        detections, and this could slow down down processing speed depending on
        the number of detections, the number of other modules currently running,
        the computer speed, etc. To reduce this, a minimum gap should be defined
        in milliseconds such that any previous detections with an end time
        older than that value (when compared to the start time of the current
        detection) will not be compared against.
    </p>
    <p>
        This function should be used with caution, since distinct overlapping
        whistles could mistakenly be ignored.
    </p>

    <img alt="" src="images/wamsAlarmsDialog.PNG">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        In addition to detections, the WAMS module can also monitor <a
        href="_mainHelp_utilities/Alarms/docs/Alarms_Overview.html">Alarm</a>
        modules and record when an alarm event is triggered.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><a name="wams_Output">Output tab</a></h3>
    <img alt="" src="images/wamsOutputDialog.PNG">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Historical mean counts are saved to both the database and a separate
        file in csv format. This is to prevent loss of history data if a new
        database is used. This tab lets the operator select the folder where the
        csv file is to be saved.
    </p>
    <p>
        Details of the csv file can be found in the <a href="WAMS_Output.html">Output</a> page.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><a name="wams_Reports">Reports tab</a></h3>
    <p>
        This tab allows the operator to generate a report summarizing the past
        counts. The report is in a Word format.
    </p>
    <img alt="" src="images/wamsReportDialog.PNG">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        The output folder to save the report to must be specified. A docx file
        can also be used as a template, to provide specific fonts, styles,
        headers and footers, etc. The template file is optional.
    </p>
    <p>
        The time period covered by the report is specified by either clicking on
        a predefined button or typing in start and end times in the appropriate
        textboxes. The format entered should be "dd MMM yyyy HH:mm:ss". Hint: if
        you are unsure of the format, click one of the buttons first. This will
        fill in the start and end times, which you can then easily modify.
    </p>
    <p>
        Use the radio button to select whether the desired times are in PAMGuard
        Time (UTC time zone) or the local PC time.
