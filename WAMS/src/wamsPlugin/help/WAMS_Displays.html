    <h1>Welfare Acoustic Monitoring System</h1>
    <h2>Displays</h2>
    <p>
        WAMS displays can be added to any User Display tab by first clicking on
        the tab, then selecting <strong><em>User Display &gt; New NMMF WAMS
        Summary Display</em></strong>.
    </p>
    <img alt="" src="images/wamsSelectDisplay.PNG">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        There are 3 elements to the display: the <a href="#wamsSumTable">Summary
        of Detections</a> table, the <a href="#wamsMeanTable">Mean Detections</a>
        table, and the <a href="#wamsChart">Chart</a>.
    </p>
    
    
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><a name="wamsSumTable">Summary of Detections table</a></h3>
    <img alt="" src="images/wamsSumTable.PNG">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        The Summary of Detections table will show the counts for the current
        day, as well as the previous 5 days (if the data is available in the
        database).
    </p>
    <p>
        The time periods are shown in the header row. Note that, in order to
        remain consistent with the time-keeping throughout PAMGuard, all times
        are based on a UTC time zone (i.e. PAMGuard Time). Therefore the counts
        shown in the display tables may not match the local computer time
        period. This must be kept in mind for post-processing and analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note also that the current time period is not updated in real time, but only
        when the end of the period has passed or PAMGuard processing is stopped.
    </p>


    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><a name="wamsMeanTable">Mean Detections table</a></h3>
    <img alt="" src="images/wamsMeanTable.PNG">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        The Mean Detections information can be found in this table. This data is
        loaded from the <a href="WAMS_Output.html#wams_CSV">csv file</a> or, if not available, calculated from tables in
        the database.
    </p>
    <p>
        The time periods are shown in the header row. Note that, in order to
        remain consistent with the time-keeping throughout PAMGuard, all times
        are based on a UTC time zone (i.e. PAMGuard Time). Therefore the counts
        shown in the display tables may not match the local computer time
        period. This must be kept in mind for post-processing and analysis.
    </p>
    <p>
        Note also that the current time period is not updated in real time, but only
        when the end of the period has passed or PAMGuard processing is stopped.
    </p>


    <br>
    <br>
    <h3><a name="wamsChart">Chart</a></h3>
    <img alt="" src="images/wamsChart.PNG">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        The chart display two time series: the counts from the past 24 hours
        (shown in blue), as well as the mean counts (shown in orange with a
        dashed line).  The chart is updated whenever the table is updated.
