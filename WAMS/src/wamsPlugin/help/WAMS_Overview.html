    <h1>Welfare Acoustic Monitoring System</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
        The Welfare Acoustic Monitoring System (WAMS) plugin provides a method
        of logging audio detections of interest and providing both an
        instantaneous count in the current time period, as well as a historical
        mean count to compare against. The size of the time period is
        user-adjustable, though hourly is the most common selection. WAMS can
        run in both real time and during post-processing of previously-recorded
        audio data, and can generate reports using operator-customized
        templates.
    </p>
    <p>
        The WAMS plugin has been designed to work in conjunction with existing core
        PAMGuard modules. A typical PAMGuard configuration consists of the following
        modules: Array Manager, Sound Acquisition, Sound Recorder, FFT Engine, Whistle &
        Moan Detector, and WAMS plugin. In addition, a database module and binary store
        module must be included in order to store output data from the detector and WAMS
        modules. A User Display is also typically included, to display a spectrogram of
        the audio signal.
